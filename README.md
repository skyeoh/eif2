# Extended Isolation Forest

This is an implementation for the Extended Isolation Forest method, which is described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.02141.pdf). It is an improvement on the original algorithm Isolation Forest, which is described (among other places) in this [paper](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/zhouzh.files/publication/icdm08b.pdf), for detecting anomalies and outliers from a data point distribution.
